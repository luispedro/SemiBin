SemiBin is a command line tool for metagenomic binning with semi-supervised siamese neural network using additional information from reference genomes and contigs themselves.
It supports single sample, co-assembly, and multi-samples binning modes.

## SemiBin2

When you install the SemiBin package you get both the newer `SemiBin2` command and the older `SemiBin` command.
It is recommended that you use the newer one exclusively for new project and the old one only for backwards compatibility.

## Tutorial

We have a tutorial available with example datasets that runs through most of the
functionality of SemiBin:

## Install

The current recommended way to install SemiBin is to use [pixi](https://pixi.sh/). Pixi will use the packages from conda-forge and bioconda to install SemiBin and its dependencies.

```bash
pixi init
pixi add bioconda::semibin
```

See [Install](install) for details and how to install from source or how to enable GPU usage.

## SemiBin Examples

See the [usage](usage) page for a more in-depth overview of how SemiBin can be used.

## Single-sample binning

[[How to generate inputs to SemiBin](../generate)]

If your assembled contigs are in a file called `S1.fa` (contig file in FASTA format) and you mapped reads and sorted the output to generate the BAM file `S1.sorted.bam`, then you there are two options.


**1. Using a pre-trained model.** This is the fastest option and should work the best if you have metagenomes from one of our prebuilt habitats (alternatively, you can use the `global` "habitat" which combines all of them).

```bash
SemiBin2 single_easy_bin \
        --environment human_gut \
        -i S1.fa \
        -b S1.sorted.bam \
        -o output
```

**2. Learn a new model.** Alternatively, you can learn a new model for your data.
The main disadvantage is that this approach will take longer:

```bash
SemiBin2 single_easy_bin \
        --environment human_gut \
        -i S1.fa \
        -b S1.sorted.bam \
        -o output
```
